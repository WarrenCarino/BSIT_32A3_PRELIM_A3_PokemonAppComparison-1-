First i notice that the files inside the pokemon search folder much more files than in the outsides files.
Second in terms of codings, in the pokemon seach folder in app.js the html codes is inside of javascript while the other is direct and it more focus on javascript.
in Last, in terms of design i think they're has same concepts but  in pokemon search more on libraries.
